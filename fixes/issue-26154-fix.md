# Fix for Issue #26154

## Problem
[Bug]: GCP and Docker Deployment Fails

## Analysis
### Summary

Walking through the tutorial on GCP fails. The suggestions for the Dockerfile errors due to suggested package installs are already reported.

When stepping back and trying to build the local docker image through the suggested `./docker-setup.sh`, it fails to build the image in both the `main` branch and the latest release tag `v2026.2.24` . Both failing during the `pnpm install --frozen-lockfile`step.

My output in the GCP console:
```
